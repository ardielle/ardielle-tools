RDL tools

## Installation

To install from source, you need go v1.4.2 or greater installed, and do this:

    go install github.com/ardielle/ardielle-tools/...@latest

The binaries will be installed into $GOPATH/bin, and the source into $GOPATH/src.

## Usage

The [rdl](rdl) contains the main `rdl` command line tool and core code generators that
the tool itself depends on. Other generators are in the [rdl-gen](rdl-gen) directory.

The `rdl` tool has the following usage:
	
	Usage: rdl [OPTIONS] COMMAND [arg...]
	
	Parse and process an RDL file.
	
	Options:
	  -p           show errors and non-exported results in a prettier way (default is false)
	  -w           suppress warnings (default is false)
	  -s           parse in strict mode (default is false)
	
	Commands:
	  help
	  version
	  parse <schemafile.rdl>
	  validate <datafile.json> <schemafile.rdl> [<typename>]
	  generate [-elt] [-o <outfile>] <generator> <schema.rdl>
	
	Generator Options:
	  -o path         Use the directory or file as output for generation. Default is stdout.
	  -b path         Specify the base path of the URL for server and client generators.
	  -e              Generate Enum constants prefixed by the type name to avoid collisions (default is false)
	  --ns namespace  Use the specified namespace for code generation. Default is to use the namespace in the schema.
	  -t              Generate precise type models, i.e. model string and numeric subtypes in Go (default is false)
	  -l package      Generate code that imports this package as 'rdl' for base type impl (instead of standard rdl library)
	  -u type         Generate the specified union type to JSON serialize as an untagged union. Default is a tagged.
	  -x key=value    Set options for external generator, e.g. -x e=true -xfoo=bar will send -e true --foo bar to external generator.
	
	Generators (accepted arguments to the generate command):
	  json               Generate the JSON representation of the schema
	  markdown           Generate the markdown representation of the schema and its comments
	  go-model           Generate the Go code for the types in the schema
	  go-client          Generate the Go code for a client to the resources in the schema
	  go-server          Generate the Go code for a server implementation  of the resources in the schema
	  go-server-project  Generate the project directory containing Go code for server and model and a mock implementation
	  java-model         Generate the Java code for the types in the schema
	  java-client        Generate the Java code for a client to the resources in the schema
	  java-server        Generate the Java code for a server implementation  of the resources in the schema
	  swagger            Generate the swagger resource for the schema. If the outfile is an endpoint, serve it via HTTP.
	  legacy             Generate the legacy (RDL v1) JSON representation of the schema
	
	  <name>             Invoke an external generator named 'rdl-gen-<name>', searched for in your $PATH. The
	                     generator is passed the -o flag if it was set, and the JSON representation of the schema
	                     is written to its stdin.
